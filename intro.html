                    <h2>Seth Jai Parkash Mukand Lal Institute </h2>
                </b><br>of Knowledge and Service is one among twenty
                two institutions spread over Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab and owe their existence
                to the munificent and philanthropic spirit of <b>Seth Mukand Lal, a close adherent of Gandhi Ji.</b>
                He came under the Gandhian influence in earlier twenties. Gandhi ji had fondly nick-named him “Pagla
                Bhagat”.
                Seth Mukand Lal reportedly bore the entire expenditure incurred in the holding of
                All India Congress Sessions on the banks of river Ravi, Lahore in 1929 where resolution for
                complete independence of India was adopted. Illiterate himself, he vowed to dispel the darkness
                of ignorance by opening educational institutions in the part of the country. Hence,
                he <b>established Mukand Lal National High School at Abdullapur (now Yamuna Nagar) as
                the first institution of the Mukand chain.</b>
    
    
                <b>Seth Jai Parkash,</b> his illustrious son accelerated the pace of opening institutions in the name of
                his<br>
                father. A selfless man, he motivated the rich, particularly the business community by saying <br>
                “Rain water accumulates on the roof top without an outlet, shall bring down the roof. Likewise,
                wealth without charity will ruin the household of wealthy”.
                He acted on this principle till the last and contributed large sums of money to the educational
                institutions.<br>
    
                <b>Shri Swatantar Kumar, Shri Ashok Kumar and Shri Vijay Kumar </b>carried on the tradition of their
                ancestors and<br>
                opened a number of institutions. Shri Ashok Kumar, Chairman, Seth Jai Parkash Mukand Lal Institutions of
                Knowledge and<br>
    
                </br> Service has been guiding the destinies of these institutions with the active assistance of his younger
                brother Shri Vijay Kumar</br>
                who is doing his best to promote Technical Education. Uncompromising on quality in terms of recruitment of
                faculty,
                infrastructure and library, he encourages and motivates everyone around him to follow the guidelines and
                remains
                strict about the fiscal discipline. It is because of his efforts that Seth Jai Parkash Mukand Lal
